# Phase 1

The goal of this phase is to get participating teams to prototype their solutions. 
## Mission and Vision

### Mission

### Vision

## System Requirements

1. The solution must comprise two parts
	1. `RQ001` the USV
		1. `RQ002` capable of manual and pre-planned navigation
		2. capable of recording video of the front of the vehicle
		3. capable of recording video of the garbage collection part of the vehicle
		4. capable of 
	2. `RQ002` a docking station which is capable of 
		1. `RQ003` charging batteries, or
		2. `RQ004` replacing batteries
		3. `RQ005` unloading collected garbage
2. When deploying the solution in a test/real site
	1. `RQ005` multiple docking stations may be used
	2. `RQ006` only one USV may be deployed
	3. `RQ`
