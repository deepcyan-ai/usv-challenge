# Phase 1

The goal of this phase is to get participating teams to prototype their solutions. 
## Mission and Vision

### Mission

### Vision

## System Requirements

#### Technological Requirements:

1. The unmanned boats must be equipped with autonomous navigation systems.
2. They should incorporate mechanisms for debris collection and disposal.
3. Integration of environmental sensors for monitoring water quality is encouraged.

#### Innovation and Sustainability:

1. Emphasis will be placed on innovation, creativity, and sustainability in boat design and operation.
2. Projects should prioritize eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient systems.

#### Documentation

4. Each team must submit a project proposal detailing their boat design, technology, and operational strategy.
5. Finalists will be required to present a detailed technical report and demonstrate their boat's functionality.

 

1. The solution must comprise two parts
	1. `RQ001` the USV
		1. `RQ002` capable of manual and pre-planned navigation
		2. capable of recording video of the front of the vehicle
		3. capable of recording video of the garbage collection part of the vehicle
		4. capable of 
	2. `RQ002` a docking station which is capable of 
		1. `RQ003` charging batteries, or
		2. `RQ004` replacing batteries
		3. `RQ005` unloading collected garbage
2. When deploying the solution in a test/real site
	1. `RQ005` multiple docking stations may be used
	2. `RQ006` only one USV may be deployed
	3. `RQ`
